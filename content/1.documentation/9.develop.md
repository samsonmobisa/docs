# Develop

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Hoppscotch as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

**We use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So all code changes happen through pull requests.**

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests.

### Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

#### Report bugs using GitHub's Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/issues); it's that easy!

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12088905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

#### Use a consistent coding style

I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try using Eslint code extensions in vs code or something similar.
